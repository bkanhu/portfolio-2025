        <p>
          I&#39;m <span className="font-medium">B Kanhu Charan</span>, a
          Frontend Developer by profession.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe a product should effectively, efficiently, and beautifully
          solve the problem it promises to address. That&apos;s why I enjoy
          working on both the design and development aspects of the product
          development lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the professional front, I have worked with various small-scale
          businesses to help them grow with the help of technology. And now
          I&apos;m working at SkentinoTech to take that one step further.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the personal side of things, I love to spend time geeking around
          computers, wondering on google maps, or brewing a nice cup of coffee.
        </p>
