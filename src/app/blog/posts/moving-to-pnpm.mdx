Iâ€™m a little late to the `pnpm` party. Okay, a lot late. But hey, I finally made the leap! Here why i moved from `npm` and you should if you haven't already (no judgment ðŸ˜œ).

But first, What is a Package Manager?

Package manager helps you:

1. Download and install packages (dependencies).
2. Resolve and manage versions.
3. Link dependencies efficiently.
4. Run scripts and tools defined in your project (via `package.json`).

How dependencies are stored?
| Feature | npm | pnpm |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Storage Model | Flat `node_modules` structure | Hard links from a global store |
| Disk Usage | Duplicates packages per project | Shares packages globally across projects |
| Speed | Slower for large deps | Much faster (due to caching + linking) |
| Determinism | Improved with npm v9+ | Highly deterministic out of the box |
| Installation Time | Slower | Faster (parallel + efficient linking) |

## Switching from `npm` to `pnpm` in an Existing Project

1. Install `pnpm` globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Remove `node_modules` and `lockfile` from your existing repositoiry:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

3. Install dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
   pnpm install
```

4. update your `engines` field in `package.json`:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=22.20.0",
  "pnpm": ">=10.18.0"
}
```

## Why Use `pnpm` Over `npm`?

- `pnpm` installs every unique version of a package once globally, then hard-links it into your project.
- So if 10 projects use `react@18.2.0`, it's stored once, used many times.
